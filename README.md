# Writeups for Exploit Education Challanges.

Convention:
- "Easy" exploits will not involve using any non-native libraries (like pwntools)
- Each excercise will have a well commented script that serves as a writeup. The script should automate the "WIN" for that challange.
- We will not reference someone else's writeups.
